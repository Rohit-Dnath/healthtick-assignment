# HealthTick Logo Setup Instructions

## Adding Your Logo

To complete the setup, you need to add your HealthTick logo to the application:

### Step 1: Add the Logo File
1. Save your HealthTick logo as `healthtick.png` in the `public` folder
2. The file path should be: `public/healthtick.png`
3. Recommended dimensions: 200x200px or higher (square format works best)

### Step 2: Optional - Add a Fallback SVG
1. If you have an SVG version, save it as `public/healthtick.svg`
2. The application will automatically fall back to the SVG if the PNG fails to load
